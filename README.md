# Robot Simulation

This project is designed to simulate the movements and interactions of robots within a virtual environment. The simulation can be controlled and observed through a web-based UI.

## Features

- Starting and stopping robot simulation
- Real-time display of robot speed, battery status, and obstacle detection
- Automatic detection of obstacles and stopping of the simulation

## Technology Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
bash
npm install

2. Starting the application:
bash
npm start

This will launch the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Architecture

- `app.js`: The main entry point of the application. It configures the Express server and defines API endpoints.
- `simulationEngine.js`: Executes the simulation of robots within a virtual environment.
- `robotController.js`: Controls the movements and interactions of robots within the simulation.
- `physicsEngine.js`: Simulates the basic physics of robots within the virtual environment.
- `ui.html`: The HTML file for the user interface.
- `ui.js`: The JavaScript file that controls the dynamic behavior of the UI.

## Contribution

## Areas Requiring Further Development

1. **Improved UI/UX**: While the current UI provides basic functionality, enhancing it to be more intuitive and visually appealing is necessary for a better user experience.

2. **Expanded Simulation Capabilities**: Adding features to increase the realism and diversity of the simulation, such as more complex robot behaviors, different types of obstacles, and interactions between robots, is considered.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Backend performance optimization is needed to efficiently handle large-scale simulations and advanced physics calculations.

4. **Enhanced Real-time Data Processing**: Strengthening data processing capabilities to more efficiently handle robot states and environmental data, providing real-time feedback to users, is required.

5. **Improved Security and Privacy**: Additional measures are necessary to protect user data and ensure system security.

6. **Documentation and Support**: Enhancing documentation and support systems is important to make it easier for developers and users to understand and use the project.
